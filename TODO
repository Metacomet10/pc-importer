# TO DO

## BUGS
- When is the earliest you can call the translations? In init() or setup()?
- There are a number of places where this can fail - should use try/catch and throw errors throughout
- Convert all numbers to actual numbers rather than strings; init.value is particularly intolerant
    - base this on the template string somehow (if the default value is a number use that as default and template)
    - or allow a format modifier somehow
- Size not being handled correctly

>>> Shouldn't include ALL the test data in the release
>>> Better way of specifying appropriate Compendiums to match against
    - can you also use Item lists if you've already imported
- Racial Traits and Race are duplicating - need to parse the actual racial trait apart


## FEATURES
>>> Add in Items or Features by name/description if not recognized and allow for manual matching
    - Include info in the Description or the flags of what it originally had
    - Also have a matching table MPMB->Foundry for common ones
    - Add more information for unrecognized Spells (e.g. Level)
>>> Invocations, Monk Features - should be handled as Class Feature 
    - Look like it's over-flowing into Extra.Notes
    - Should be parsed very much like or maybe just appended?
        - but appears with (Eldritch Invocation, or (Ki Feature, instead of <words> nn


## FIXED BUGS
- Leo.xfdf:
    DONE: Intimidation proficiency not recognized
    DONE - Dueling Fighting Style needs to be matched by words
FIXED: Bug: Need to remove :'s and also store what the original match was
FIXED: Bug: Items are being duplicated because of tradegoods and items - need to reverse the iteration

## COMPLETED FEATURES
DONE Read an XFDF file
DONE Parse into internal data structure
DONE Create internal JSON representation
DONE Create Actor from that JSON
DONE Item creation can and should be batched
DONE Class Features matched
DONE Need to loop through Feats for reference "Feat Name ?"
DONE Racial Features (extract from Race entry?)
DONE Include DDB packs and a way of adding your own (in Settings)
     - fill in the field; eventually a checkbox? Or just include them all
DONE - Will need a progress indicator because importing/matching can take a while
    - For now, just added LOADING indicator on the name which goes away when done
DONE Inventory - include quantity and weights
DONE Parallelize the item matching
PARTIAL - Have a custom Item sheet that presents possible matches, and then replaces with the found match
        - this is also a standalone module for other Imports
