# TO DO
- Add additional items consisting of classes, inventory, spells, features etc. by referencing the Compendium

## BUGS
- When is the earliest you can call the translations? In init() or setup()?
- Shouldn't create a new Actor if it already exists - just do an update using the data or the JSON
- There are a number of places where this can fail - should use try/catch and throw errors throughout
- Convert all numbers to actual numbers rather than strings; init.value is particularly intolerant
    - base this on the template string somehow (if the default value is a number use that as default and template)
    - or allow a format modifier somehow

## FEATURES
- Will need a progress indicator because importing/matching can take a while
>>>Needs to be a whole matching step where we look at exist Compendiums or Actors/Spells etc.
    - seems like those should be settings to determine where to look
- Probably should push the logic around which constructor to use into Actor5eExt based on the importType passed






## FIXED BUGS


## COMPLETED FEATURES
DONE Read an XFDF file
DONE Parse into internal data structure
DONE Create internal JSON representation
DONE Create Actor from that JSON
