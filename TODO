# TO DO

## BUGS
- When is the earliest you can call the translations? In init() or setup()?
- Shouldn't create a new Actor if it already exists - just do an update using the data or the JSON
- There are a number of places where this can fail - should use try/catch and throw errors throughout



## FEATURES
- Will need a progress indicator because importing/matching can take a while
>>> Add in Items or Features by name/description if not recognized and allow for manual matching 
    - Have a custom Item sheet that presents possible matches, and then replaces with the found match 
- Invocations
>>> Racial Features (extract from Race entry?)



## FIXED BUGS
- Leo.xfdf:
    DONE: Intimidation proficiency not recognized
    DONE - Dueling Fighting Style needs to be matched by words
FIXED: Bug: Need to remove :'s and also store what the original match was
FIXED: Bug: Items are being duplicated because of tradegoods and items - need to reverse the iteration 

## COMPLETED FEATURES
DONE Read an XFDF file
DONE Parse into internal data structure
DONE Create internal JSON representation
DONE Create Actor from that JSON
DONE Item creation can and should be batched
DONE Class Features matched
DONE Need to loop through Feats for reference "Feat Name ?"
