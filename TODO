# TO DO
- Add additional items consisting of classes, inventory, spells, features etc. by referencing the Compendium

## BUGS
- When is the earliest you can call the translations? In init() or setup()?

## FEATURES
DONE Read an XFDF file
DONE Parse into internal data structure
DONE Create internal JSON representation
DONE Create Actor from that JSON
- Pass only the mapping functions, not the whole importer
>>>Needs to be a whole matching step where we look at exist Compendiums or Actors/Spells etc.
    - seems like those should be settings to determine where to look

## FIXED BUGS


## COMPLETED FEATURES
