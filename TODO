# TO DO
>>> Add Features and then try to match them with the previously added Class

## BUGS
- When is the earliest you can call the translations? In init() or setup()?
- Shouldn't create a new Actor if it already exists - just do an update using the data or the JSON
- There are a number of places where this can fail - should use try/catch and throw errors throughout


## FEATURES
- Will need a progress indicator because importing/matching can take a while
>>> Add in Items or Features by name/description if not recognized and allow for manual matching 
    - Have a custom Item sheet that presents possible matches, and then replaces with the found match 




## FIXED BUGS


## COMPLETED FEATURES
DONE Read an XFDF file
DONE Parse into internal data structure
DONE Create internal JSON representation
DONE Create Actor from that JSON
DONE Item creation can and should be batched
