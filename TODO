# TO DO

## BUGS
- When is the earliest you can call the translations? In init() or setup()?
- There are a number of places where this can fail - should use try/catch and throw errors throughout
- Convert all numbers to actual numbers rather than strings; init.value is particularly intolerant
    - base this on the template string somehow (if the default value is a number use that as default and template)
    - or allow a format modifier somehow
- Size not being handled correctly

>>> Shouldn't include ALL the test data in the release
IN PROGRESS Better way of specifying appropriate Compendiums to match against
    - can you also use Item lists if you've already imported
- Racial Traits and Race are duplicating - need to parse the actual racial trait apart


## FEATURES
>>> Unrecognized Features and Items:
    - Include info in the Description or the flags of what it originally had
    - Already have what is available for Items (Row, Weight, Amount)
    - Also have a matching table MPMB->Foundry for common ones


>>> Improve the Item sheet matcher: 
    - Way of improving the search based on the info we have (maybe have some search fields at the top, including level)        
    - Have the different Compendiums in different collapsible sections- right-click context-menu to replace 
    - Arrange unknown spells by level (should be automatic)
- Import "weapons" from the Attacks portion if they don't appear in Inventory
- Some way of specifying that you want to pull/parse different sections of the sheet for information
    - when you start the imprort it gives you another dialog with different parts of the sheet




## FIXED BUGS
- Leo.xfdf:
    DONE: Intimidation proficiency not recognized
    DONE - Dueling Fighting Style needs to be matched by words
FIXED: Bug: Need to remove :'s and also store what the original match was
FIXED: Bug: Items are being duplicated because of tradegoods and items - need to reverse the iteration

## COMPLETED FEATURES
DONE Read an XFDF file
DONE Parse into internal data structure
DONE Create internal JSON representation
DONE Create Actor from that JSON
DONE Item creation can and should be batched
DONE Class Features matched
DONE Need to loop through Feats for reference "Feat Name ?"
DONE Racial Features (extract from Race entry?)
DONE Include DDB packs and a way of adding your own (in Settings)
     - fill in the field; eventually a checkbox? Or just include them all
DONE - Will need a progress indicator because importing/matching can take a while
    - For now, just added LOADING indicator on the name which goes away when done
DONE Inventory - include quantity and weights
DONE Parallelize the item matching
DONE - Have a custom Item sheet that presents possible matches, and then replaces with the found match
    - Right-click option to Replace or Add
NOT DONE: Add more information for unrecognized Spells (e.g. Level) 
    - Doesn't seem possible (not stored with the spell name or description)
DONE Invocations, Monk Features, Horizon Walker features - should be handled as Class Feature 
    - Look like it's over-flowing into Extra.Notes
    - Should be parsed very much like or maybe just appended?
        - but appears with (Eldritch Invocation, or (Ki Feature, instead of <words> nn
